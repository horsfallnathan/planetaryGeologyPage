Mud pools and fumaroles could be observed, as well as the characteristic weathering and alteration of the rocks due to the emitted CO2 and H2S turning the surface water acidic.

At both sides of the rift zone, the strata are tilted towards the center, creating a Graben structure with a synthetic rotation of the blocks (dipping in direction of the fault) and an offset of the normal faults of approximately 40 m. Up to 4 km of the rift valley are filled with sediments. The total extension of the graben sums up to be about 100 m in 10000 a, since the fissures run through a lava flow of that age hence must be younger than the flow, which results in a spreading rate of about 1 cm/a.",

By using the same principle, a rate of vertical offset of 0.4 cm/a can be assumed which is about half of the spreading rate. Given that usually the spreading does not occur in a constant manner but in several events of more extreme spreading, the last of those events took place in 1789 when the whole segment of Allmannagjà dropped by 1-3 m. Afterwards the “Alping”, the gathering of the parliament that was founded in this location in 960, making the Allmannagjá graben a historically important place, was moved to Reykjavík due to the fact that the good acoustics that this place stood out for in the first place was lost.",

The terminology for it would be that the sediment is not ripe. It is a fore set bed with fining upward sequence, so it was an alluvial fan from a delta deposition. The material is a redeposited ash sediment with pebbles from a Hekla eruption. A large scale conglomerate with rounded to subrounded boulders on the meter-scale is discordantly deposited above the mentioned.

Standing on the outline of Iceland’s fourth biggest glacier -a landmark reacting very quickly to climatic changes- distinct glacial features can be found in its surrounding. Sólheimajökull shaped the valley, polished its rocks and left striking glacial striations. The pro-glacial lake, a whaleback and several moraines (terminal, lateral and ground ~) are some of the characteristic glacial features of which there are plenty at this stop.",

It formed due to sea erosion affecting the 120 m high, steep cliffs. Dyrhólaey was created by a surtseyan-type of eruption 80 ka ago, so submarine eruptions producing a lot of tephra, followed by effusive lava flows as soon as the crater reaches the surface. The base of this promotory is made up of palagonized tuff and lava flows, forming columnar lava formations on top. At the contact zones of tuff and the lava flows, a fritted margin thus alteration and change in texture and colour could be observed.",

The concave shaped, cave-like wall of the outcrop (Figure 2.1a) was formed by the erosion of one of the paleochannels of the River Rhine. The former water levels can be seen on the eroded wall (Figure 2.1b). Bedding orientation was measured as 224/30 (Dip Direction/Dip Angle).",
